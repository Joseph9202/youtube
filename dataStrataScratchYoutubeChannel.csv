About The Platform:

I'm using StrataScratch (https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=YT+description+link), a platform that allows you to practice real data science interview questions. There are over 1000+ interview questions that cover coding (SQL and python), statistics, probability, product sense, and business cases.

So, if you want more interview practice with real data science interview questions, visit https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=YT+description+link. All questions are free and you can even execute SQL and python code in the IDE, but if you want to check out the solutions from me or from other users, you can use ss15 for a 15% discount on the premium plans.
